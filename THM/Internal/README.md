# Explanation
```
First we started by enumerating the ports using nmap which found ports 22 and 80. Once this was done I started looking into the 
website and through a gobuster scan we found that it is running wordpress. I ran a WordPress scan and didnt find much. after bruteforcing the login page using WPScan. I uploaded a php reverse shell which gave me the www-data user then from there I enumerated the systeam and found a txt file called wp-save.txt that had login creds for aubreanna, from there we sshed into the system and found the user.txt file with the first we also found jenkins.txt file that told us there was a jenkins server running on 127.0.0.1:8080. There is a internal jenkins server running on port 8080 after bruteforcing the login page i gained access. After using a Groovy Reverse Shell we had access to the jenkins user. After looking around the system we found the notes.txt that 
gave us the root creds after login as root we got the root flag
